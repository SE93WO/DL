My solutions to the projects assigned for the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree

Project | Concepts | Tools 
--- | --- | ---
[Facial Keypoints](CVND/Project/Facial_Keypoint_Detection) | Face Detection, Haar Cascades, CNNs, keypoints | OpenCV, pytorch
[Image Captioning](CVND/Project/Image_Captioning) |  COCO dataset, transfer learning, EncoderCNN/DecoderRNN, LSTMs, feature vectors, word embeddings | pytorch, torchvision, nltk
