CVND
-----
My solutions to the projects assigned for the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree

Project | Concepts | Tools 
--- | --- | ---
[Facial Keypoints](CVND/Facial_Keypoints) | Face Detection, Haar Cascades, CNNs, keypoints | OpenCV, pytorch
[Image Captioning](CVND/Image_Captioning) |  COCO dataset, transfer learning, EncoderCNN/DecoderRNN, LSTMs, feature vectors, word embeddings | pytorch, torchvision, nltk
[Implement SLAM](CVND/Implement_SLAM) | Offline SLAM, Online SLAM  | numpy, pandas, seaborn

Further explorations of computer vision related topics, such as image segmentation, detection of corners, edges, and contours, k-means clustering, ORB and HOG feature vectors, CNNs, and YOLO, can be found in the [Exercises](CVND/Exercises) folder.

Implementation
--------------
CV papers implement a Deep Learning Paper to get some hands on the current state of the art model or current field of research.
 
### Architecture:
